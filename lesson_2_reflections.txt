What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

   It creates a .git folder that stores metadata on all the files and folders 
   inside the directory that the .git folder is located in. From there, every 
   time you make a commit or a change, data on that file is stored in .git. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

   The working directory contains everything that you're working on as well as
   the git repository. The repository is a git representation of that directory.
   The staging area is the intermediate area between the two: files from the
   working directory that you care about track are put into the staging area, 
   where you can then commit the changes you make to the repository.
