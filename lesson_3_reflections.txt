When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If I am collaborating with other people on a project, or I want my work on a project to be accessible by
  other people, then it would very beneficial to have my work online. This enables easy accessibility and
  teamwork, and is much easier than copying and sending individual files through email or whatever you'd use
  otherwise.
