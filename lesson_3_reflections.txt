When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If I am collaborating with other people on a project, or I want my work on a 
  project to be accessible by other people, then it would very beneficial to 
  have my work online. This enables easy accessibility and teamwork, and is much 
  easier than copying and sending individual files through email or whatever 
  you'd use otherwise.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Other people may have pushed changes to the remote, while you may be working
   on things unrelated to those, or doing the same things in different ways, and
   it would definitely not be a good idea for other people's changes to be 
   automatically be pulled to your local repo.
